## Description
### This is a timed trivia game, where the player has 15 seconds to answer a multiple choice question. As the game progresses it keeps track of both correct and incorrect answers, to be displayed at the end (not working).  There is a timer on the screen so the player knows exactly how much time they have left to answer the question. If they don't answer in time, the question is counted as incorrect.
